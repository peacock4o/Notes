###  "Instance-based learning in dynamic decision making"
- `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0364021303000314`
- Experienced decision makers show lower fit to heuristics and higher standard deviation from their own actions compared to their behavior at the beginning of the learning.
- Decision makers use accumulated and prior knowledge increasingly.
- Instance-based learning theory (IBLT) proposes that in DDM situations, people learn by:
	- Accumulation
	- Recognition
	- Refinement of instances, which include:
		- Information on the DM situation, or "context"
		- Action
		- Result of action
- Prior work
	- Implicit and explicit learning
	- Learning from examples and by doing
	- Deductive and inductive learning
	- Learning "mechanisms"
		- "Knowledge base"
			- What do I know?
			- Accumulation of knowledge in declarative form
		- "Recognition"
			- Is this thing familiar to me? Maybe check knowledge base for this
			- Discriminate among familiar objects
		- "Strategies"
			- How can I do this thing?
			- Adaptive production systems
		- "Evaluation Functions"
			- How do I decide what to do next?
			- Assessment of different alternatives to control the continuation of search in problem solving
	- Chunking theory
		- People accumulate chunks in long-term memory
		- Experts recognize chunks and hold links to them in short-term memory
		- Experts also search very selectively, using environmental cues to narrow search trees
		- Ex: chess
			- Skill develops mainly through recognition of features and familiarity of chunks
			- A new player will look at every possible move they can take before selecting a (likely) suboptimal choice
			- A more experienced player will look at a smaller subset of moves that they believe to be stronger, preemptively eliminating poorer options in their minds.
			- A master will look at the overall state of the game.
				- "Highly skilled people use other long-term memory structures **(templates)** in addition to chunks in short-term memory (Simon & Gobet, 1996). Experts then, may not only retrieve larger chunks, but templates filled with chunks in the slots."
				- We know chess is dynamic under time constraints. Otherwise, it's (theoretically) a memorization game. See blitz chess!
		- "Recognition" and "strategies" useful here
	- Hintzman's instance-based recognition model
		- Instances of examples are used to derive abstract concepts
		- Secondary memory (SM) accumulates knowledge, traces are retrieved from SM by the communication of a "probe"
			- "Probe" = recall request, "echo" = response
		- Compiled into a system called MINERVA 2
			- In MINERVA 2, learning consists of copying the features of an experience into a trace structure using probibalistic method.
		- "Recognition" is useful for DDM
	- Medin and Schaffer's theory
		- People learn to classify objects based on the retrieval of stored examples
		- Classification of a stimulus is based on similarity to stored category examples
		- "Similarity" in itself is an important concept used in many other models
		- "Recognition", "strategies", and "evaluation functions" are most useful here
