## LECTURE 1 - 4/1/2025

- Overview
	- First half - focus on quantum information
		- Quantum key distribution, non-local games, entanglement
	- Second half - focus on quantum computation
		- Quantum computation, Grover search, Shor's alg.
- Mostly theory
- What is quantum computation?
	- Computation based on the laws of quantum mechanics
- Quantum mechanics are strange - see double slit experiment
	- You have a source. It emits objects.
	- To the right, there's a wall with two slits
	- To the right of that, there's a screen that leaves traces where objects collide with it
	- Case 1: Ping pong ball (classical)
		- Most bounce off the wall, the ones that go through travel in a straight line to the screen
		- Each ball hits the screen at a single point (!)
		- Each ball ends up behind a slit (!)
	- Case 2: Water waves (classical)
		- When they hit the slit, they radiate out from each slit
			- At some point, they interact with one another
		- What do we expect to see when the waves hit the screen?
			- The heights of the two waves add up - screen image is determined by **interference**
		- 		- "Constructive" - resulting added wave grows in magnitude
				- "Destructive" - resulting added wave decreases in magnitude
			- At various engles from the slits, we expect to see destructive interference
			- So we end up seeing gradient-style bands on the screen - called "interference patterns"
		- The wave hits the detector at many points
		- We also see an "interference" pattern
	- Case 3: Photon
		- When emitting photons, they hit at single points on the screen 
			- But the distribution resembles an interference pattern!
		- How could this be possible?
			- Maybe the photons are interfering with one another?
				- No. Even when sending isolated photons, we still see this
			- Each photon is interfering with itself?
				- Remember - interference was caused by water waves passing through both slits - so a photon couldn't be doing this
	- Case 3*: Photon with camera			
		- Add a "camera" (electron emitter) and see if the photon is passing through left or right
		- When we do this, **the interference pattern disappears** (?!?!) 
- Quantum mechanics explain these phenomena
	- In particular, with computing, we're trying to orchestrate interference patterns
		- Like constructive = 1, destructive = 0
- Looking ahead
	- Simplest quantum system has two degrees of freedom
	- The state of the quantum system can be in "superposition" of the two
	- Ex.
		- Photon in double slit experiment
			- DoF: Left/Right
		- Photon polarization
			- DoF - Vertical/Horizontal
		- Electron spin
			- DoF: Up/Down
	- We call a quantum system with two DoF a **qubit**
- Complex number review
	- Form some kind of number system
	- Made up of imaginary numbers, which are made up of the imaginary unit i
		- By def., $i^2 = -1$
		- Can also be thought of as $i = \sqrt{-1}$, but be careful!
		- Imaginary numbers are multiples of i: $3i$, $\pi i$, $y * i$ for any $y \in R$
	- Complex numbers are numbers of the form $a + i * b$ where $a, b \in R$
		- $a$ is the "real" part
		- $b * i$ is the "imaginary" part
	- Can be helpful to visualize in complex plane
	- Properties and operations
		- Let $z = a + i * b$ and $z' = a' + i' * b'$
		- *Magnitude* (AKA absolute value*)
			- $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
		- *Addition*
			- $z + z' = (a + a`) + i * (b + b')$
		- *Multiplication*
			- Defined to obey the "commutative", "associative", and "distributive" properties
			- $z * z' = (a + ib) * (a' + ib') = (a * a' - b * b') + i(a * b' - b * a')$ 
				- After distributing, simplifying $i^2$, and grouping real/imaginary parts
	- We will also encounter the *conjugate* of a complex number
		- Each complex number has a "sibling" (conjugate)
		- Conjugate of $z = a + i * b$ is $\overline{z} = a - i * b$
			- Reflected across the "real" axis on the complex plane
		- Note: when you multiply $z * \overline{z}$, you get $a^2 - i^2 * b^2 = a^2 + b^2 = |z|^2$ - magnitude squared!
- Linear algebra review
	- Usually, we consider vectors in $R^2$ or $R^n$
	- In this class, we will consider vectors in $C^2$ or $C^n$ (complex plane)
		- $v = (v_1, ..., v_n) \in C^n$
	- Properties and operations
		- Let $v = (v_1, ..., v_n)$ and $w = (w_1, ..., w_n)$
			- Remember - these are complex numbers at each index!!!
		- *Addition*
			- $v + w = (v_1 + w_1, ..., v_n + w_n)$
		- *Scalar multiplication*
			- For each $\lambda \in C$, $\lambda * v = (\lambda * v_1, ..., \lambda * v_n)$
		- *Norm of a vector*
			- ||v|| = \sqrt{|v_1|^2 + ... + |v_n|^2}
		- *Inner product*
			- $<v,w> = \overline{v}_1w_1 + ... + \overline{v}_nw_n$
			- Three properties here:
				- $<v, v> = 0$ if and only if $v = 0^n$
				- $<v, v> = \overline{v}_1v_1 + ... + \overline{v}_nv_n$
					- But remember conjugate property! So you're adding together all the conjugates, which becomes 0
